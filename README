README for count_nt
===================

Author: Fredrik Boulund
Purpose: I needed a small simple nucleotide counting tool and figured I'd write it in D.

Comparisons
===========
There are three different programs in this repo:

* count_nt.d  --  The first program
* count.d     --  The second version, where I tried to optimize but made it slower.
* count.py    --  A Python version for comparison. It's not that bad actually.
